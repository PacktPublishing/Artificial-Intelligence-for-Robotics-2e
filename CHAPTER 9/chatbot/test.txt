Men are all alike.

IN WHAT WAY?

They're always bugging us about something or other.

CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE?

Well, my boyfriend made me come here.

YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?

He says I'm depressed much of the time.

I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED.

It's true.
I am unhappy.

DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY.

I need some help, that much seems certain.

WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU GOT SOME HELP?

Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.

TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

My mother takes care of me.

WHO ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY TAKES CARE OF YOU?

My father.

YOUR FATHER?

You are like my father in some ways.

WHAT RESEMBLANCE DO YOU SEE?

You are not very aggressive, but I think you don't want me to notice that.

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I AM NOT VERY AGGRESSIVE?

You don't argue with me.

WHY DO YOU THINK I DON'T ARGUE WITH YOU?

You are afraid of me.

DOES IT PLEASE YOU TO BELIEVE I AM AFRAID OF YOU?

My father is afraid of everybody.

WHAT ELSE COMES TO YOUR MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF YOUR FATHER?

Bullies.

DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT
THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?
